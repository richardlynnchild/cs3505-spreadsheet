- Created the intial file structure for PS6. 
- Implemented a way to switch the selected cell by using the arrow keys or TAB.
  However this removed the ability to scroll through the spreadsheet with the arrow
  keys.
TODO: - add convienent scrolling features (scroll wheel, automatic scrolling when changing selected cell, etc.)

- Implemnted a method for writing user keyboard input to the currently selected cell.
	- Added Backspace functionality

NOTE: After today's lecture I've realized that my implementation could be significantly improved by putting the 
arrow key/tab cell selection functionality into SpreadsheetPanel.
NEW TODO:	-  put cell selection functionality into SPreadsheetPanel
			-  Change the way a cell is written, to be more in line with the specification.

- Fixed the issues involving opening the project.
- Implemented the help menu to give the user information on how to use the spreadsheet.
- Had to be recreated from scratch due to an issue with Github.
- The basics of the spreadsheet work, so now we will begin implementing the dependency graphs.

[Personal Software Process]
My original estimate was that this project would last around 5-6 hours.
My estimates are getting worse, as I underestimate the time it took to fix the issues with the repository.

(Nathan Boehm)
NOTE: problems with Brady's repository have been resolved.
- Modified UI.
- Implemented new system for writing text to cells.
	- setting focus to formula text box.
	- setting cell value on enter key or EnterButton click.
	- "Quality of life" feature: setting cursor to end of text in the formula box.
	- Formula box set to contents of cell on cell selection change.
- Implemented use of spreadsheet object to handle spreadsheet logic.
- implemented Save As and Quicksave.
- Implemented helper methods for the various methods i've implemented.
- Added documentation and modified file structure.
- Modified Help menu descriptions and placement.
- Added formula evaluation functionality to cells.

-Added bonus code that finds the sum, average, and count of either a selected row or column. 
-Uses two buttons on the menu. Also has close buttons if you want to get rid of the information.
-Commented out my code in Form1.cs.

-In total, I would say I personally spent about 6-7 hours on this project. There were some issues with github that cause the time taken to increase.
-This is above my initial estimatated time spent. My estimation was off. My biggest issue was misunderstanding how long it would take to get our repository issues sorted out.
